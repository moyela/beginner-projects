This repository contains some of the code I'll be working on as I progress on my journey to become a high-earning (I hope), well-rounded developer.

I'm taking freeCodeCamp classes to start, and also in the ideation state for building Kampus, and I hope this all goes well.

This is a note to self, and I'll update it if anything changes moving forwars.

Thanks,
Wemi Moyela
